You see a commanding shrimp figure emerge in front of you.
She seems to be talking to someone on the phone.

Hilma: I swear, Johnny, if ya don't fix yer attitude...[#angry]
Hilma: I'll make sure you'll sleep with da fishes soon enough, y'hear?

Hilma: And not in a good way...

She hangs up the phone and notices you...

Her countenance and demeanor change immediately after seeing you.

Hilma: Awwww who's this cuuutie heree???[#love]
