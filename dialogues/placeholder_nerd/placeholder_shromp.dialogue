Shompy: please leave me alone ......

~ higher_love
Shompy sits, preoccupied in a book as always. It looks like a different book from the one he was reading the first time you met.
His eyes light up as he notices you [#sparkle]
Shompy: Oh hey! I'm working my way through another really interesting book in the field of game studies
Shompy: If you're interested in hearing? 
He looks at you, expectantly [#normal]
- Sure, I'm interested!
	=> higher_love_interest
- hmmmm I'm really busy today.... sorry....

Shompy: Fantastic! This one is an exciting paper by Bo Ruberg on the queer posthuman implications of unplayable games....[#love]
...You begin to tune out again....
Shompy: ...And while the deer ass [i]is[/i] luscious and large, I'm unsure how it ties into queer identity as a whole....[#nervous]
...You fade back into your own thoughts ....
Shompy: ...But a video game that cannot be played??? How cool is that??? [#sparkle]
Shompy looks at you, waiting for an answer [#normal]
- It's pretty cool!
	=> higher_love_love
- Isn't that just a "movie"?

You see a preoccupied shrimp caught up in his book. He seems to be mumbling to himself.
Shompy: Huizinga? … No… No…[#nervous]
- Make eye contact.
	=> eyecontact
- Who's Huizinga?
	=> huizinga


~ eyecontact
You try to make eye contact, but it is almost like he is deliberately avoiding your gaze.[#nervous]
- Keep staring at him
	=> keepstaring
- Who's Huizinga?
	=> huizinga

Catfish: Who's Huizinga? [#normal]
Shompy: Oh… You scared me… Didn’t realize you were there.
- I literally fished you like 5 seconds ago...
	=> fivesec
- It's alright...
	Catfish: It's alright, sometimes I also lose myself in stories.
	=> getlost


~ keepstaring
The man seems to be unyielding in his pursuit of eye-contact-avoidance. [#nervous]
He stalwartly keeps reading his book.
Shompy: Narratologist prick...
- I thought you wanted to be here? [#normal]
- You seem to really like that book.[#normal]
	=> END!


~ fivesec

Shompy: I'm sorry, I'm just nervous... It was my aunt's idea to get into the dating pool. [#sad]
Shompy: I'm not quite sure if I'm ready to date yet...
- You shouldn't blindly follow other people's advice.[#normal]
	Catfish: You shouldn't blindly follow other people's advice.
	=> END!
- Well... Sorry for being rude... [#normal]
	Catfish: Well... Sorry for being rude... 
	Catfish: I get unpleasant sometimes when I'm nervous. 
	Catfish: Truth to be told...
	Catfish: I'm also not sure if I'm ready to date anyone yet.
	Catfish: After all that...
	You aimlessly kick a pebble on the ground.
	Eyes fixed to earth, almost looking for...
	Something that isn't there anymore.
	Catfish: So maybe we can just... Talk, for now?
	=> END!


~ getlost
Shompy: Well, it's not a story. I was reading an article by... 
Shompy: Well, never mind, I don't want to bore you with my interests...[#sad]
- Don't be silly, I'd love to know who you were reading.[#normal]
	=> ough
- Yeah, I'd rather talk about anything else than science, really[#normal]
	=> END!

Shompy: A-are you sure???[#nervous]

	=> hurt

~ wow
Shompy: Well! It's an article by Espen Aarseth where he defines what a video game is using several thousand flow charts [#sparkle]
Shompy: As you can see a game is made up of several "sub elements" involving "narrative segments", "paidea particles", "ludus particles", "infogrames"....
.... You tune out ....
.... Shompy doesn't notice....[#normal]
Shompy: .... And overall I think it's quite exhaustive but I'm unsure if "cozy games" fit into this frame work .... [#nervous]
.... You zone out again ....
Shompy: ....Anyway! You've been so attentive!!! I never thought someone would care so much about formalist game studies!! [#sparkle]

Shompy likes you more now!
