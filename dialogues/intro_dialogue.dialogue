Your cursor is hovering shakily over a button. That button is marked "Block Contact". 
This button is connected to a menu surrounded by pictures of shrimp. A single shrimp, in particular. Look, there they are travelling! They're dancing at a club now! Surrounded by friends. They seem happy.
Happy without you.
With a sudden burst of energy, you click the button and watch as your ex's profile disappears from view. It's time to move on.

All the eligibile shrimp bachelors gather at the "dating lake", somewhere adjacent to SuolijÃ¤rvi. Shrimponia's buffest, most beautiful, most desperate bachelors. They leave at midnight.
You've brought your rod.
